<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University at Buffalo. 
I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2022, 
working with <a href="https://leiying.engin.umich.edu">Prof. Lei Ying</a>. 
I received my Ph.D. degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of The Ohio State University in December, 2021, advised by
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yingbinliang/home">Prof. Yingbin Liang</a>. 
I was a visiting student research collaborator at the department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University working with <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor">Prof. H. Vincent Poor</a>. 
Previously I obtained my B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2016.</p>
<h2>Research </h2>
<p>I have been working at the intersection of optimization, machine learning and networked systems, on both the theory and application sides. 
My major research focuses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bilevel optimization and its application in deep learning </p>
</li>
<li><p>Meta-learning and continual learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Large-scale stochastic optimization </p>
</li>
<li><p>Federated learning and communication networks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>To Prospective Students</h2>
<p>I am looking for highly motivated students with strong mathematical backgrounds and/or programming skills in machine learning and optimization to work with me. Please directly apply to the Ph.D. program in <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html">Computer Science and  Engineering</a>, and mention me in your application materials. You can also send me an email with your CV and transcript. I cannot reply to every email inquiring the position suitability due to the large volume. </p>
<p>Moreover, intern and visiting students are highly welcome! </p>
